# Git View React App

## Created for demonstration purposes.

## What would I do better?

With the chance to go back and modify this and improve it I would make the following changes to the end product:

- Display a GitHub User profile for the searched user somewhere on the page.
- Improve accessibility.
- Unit testing.
- Add animation for loading whilst awaiting data and rendering of information.
- Embed searchbox div inside form component for cleaner App.js
- Implement state management
